# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- How does the system behave when the user interrupts playback mid-sentence and a new audio chunk arrives?
- What happens when the streaming service exceeds the 1.2s latency target or drops the WebSocket connection?
- How is consent enforced when memory/emotion features are disabled or redaction fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Voice loop MUST stream microphone audio to ASR and return the first spoken response in under 1.2s (record actual baseline).
- **FR-002**: Playback MUST honour `END_OF_SPEECH` interrupts by draining buffers across ASR/LLM/TTS boundaries.
- **FR-003**: Module integrations MUST reuse the event schema consumed by `soul_speak/mic/run_and_speak.py` or document contract changes and harness updates.
- **FR-004**: Memory/emotion data MUST flow through configurable providers with consent flags and redaction rules defined in `conf/`.
- **FR-005**: Observability MUST emit structured logs or metrics for latency, disconnections, and consent toggles without leaking transcripts.
- **FR-006**: User-facing文本与语音交互默认使用中文；如需其它语言，规范中必须记录触发条件与回退方案。
- **FR-007**: 新引入或重构的类必须使用 `from attrs import define, field` 并以 `@define` 声明字段；若无法使用 attrs，需在设计中说明例外原因。

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-008**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Latency metric, e.g., "Average first-response audio latency ≤ 1.2s across 10 trial runs"]
- **SC-002**: [Reliability metric, e.g., "Playback interruption handling succeeds in 99% of simulated cuts"]
- **SC-003**: [Consent metric, e.g., "Memory/emotion toggles correctly persist user preference across sessions"]
- **SC-004**: [Business/experience metric, e.g., "NPS or qualitative feedback improves when emotion tagging enabled"]
