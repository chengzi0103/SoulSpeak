## 🌌 Project Vision 项目愿景

We believe voice has soul. When we miss someone, it's often their voice we long for.  
Through AI, SoulSpeak re-creates personalized voices based on user-provided data, and makes them speak in a deeply emotional, caring tone.

我们相信，声音可以传达灵魂的温度。  
SoulSpeak 希望通过 AI 技术，让声音成为灵魂沟通的桥梁，让想念不再孤单。
